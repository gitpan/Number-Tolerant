=head1 METHODS

=head2 valid_args

  my @args = $type_class->valid_args(@_);

If the arguments to C<valid_args> are valid arguments for this type of
tolerance, this method returns their canonical form, suitable for passing to
C<L</construct>>.  Otherwise this method returns false.

=head2 construct

  my $object_guts = $type_class->construct(@args);

This method is passed the output of the C<L</valid_args>> method, and should
return a hashref that will become the guts of a new tolerance.

=head2 parse

  my $tolerance = $type_class->parse($string);

This method returns a new, fully constructed tolerance from the given string
if the given string can be parsed into a tolerance of this type.
